        equipment room undergoes daily, weekly, monthly and annual maintenance
        check-ups to ensure optimal performance while preventing unexpected,
        costly repairs. It’s equally important to select equipment to remain
        compliant with state and federal regulations or environmentally safe to
        protect the environment for future generations.
